This is an example of an Agriculture Data Collector. It is based on YAML and easy for adaptation.

To setup:

1. Download the repository as a .zip file
2. Unzip it
3. Open the folder unzipped through a programming software(PyCharm(Recommended),VS Code)
4. Install the packages listed in the requirements.txt through terminal
5. Run the main.py

Pretty new to programming, hope it can be useful!
